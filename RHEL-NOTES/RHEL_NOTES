gZIP/bzip2 archive and compress both
##################Compresssion (deflattig) and decompression(inflatting)

gzip : it is bit fast but low compression
gunzip: to uncompress gzip file
bzip2: it is slow but high compression
bunzip2: to uncompress bzip2 

Note:
compresss file can not be read using cat but can be read with zcat comamnd
zcat: to read gzip
bzcat: to read bzip2 compression

################Archive
zip <destination address + file nane.zp> <what you want to archive/backup>

estention of the archive file just not matter but face difficulty during unarchie to check formate 
file <filename> 

REname the extention or file name
mv <filename to change>  <new name for file>
mv: is also used  to cut and pass data



#########################  Quires regarding zip/unzip
1-additing new file in existing zip
2-how to exreaxt specific file from zip
3-how we can change the compression ratio
4- how we can proctact zip using password





####################### TAR : Tape archive ##### (It is linux native tool)
1- it only archive not compression


tar -cvf <filenme.tar> : create tar file where cvf mean create verbose file
tar -tvf <filename.tar>: view tar file where tvf mean list verbose file

to use compression with tar we have two options
1- tar + gzip = tar -zcvf <filename>: add z to represent zip
2-tar +bzip2 = tar -jcvf <filenema> add j to represent bzip2





################# Backup tool ###########
cp: copy past  (does not copy directory)
cp -rv : also copy directory
rsync: it is very powerful tool (local and remote backup)
rsync -rv : for directory backup
scp : this is also used for backuo

rsync -avz <sourse>  <destyination> : here -avz  z mean compress

1- rsync update the backup file based on modify time

stat <filename>; this commnad use to get detail of the file 


############ Commercial Backup tool
1- vertias netbackup
2- windows NT backup
3- TS<
4-VEEAM
5-DELL Networker
6-EMC Networker

##### In linux we can use open sourse tool to use the above mentioned software

AMANDA + ZAMANDA + BACULA + BACKUPC


############ Hard disk Related topics 
addd hard disk if there is no space available in / directory

1- add external physical hDD
2- use usb drive as drive
3- use SAN box (collection of hard disk)
SAN box: hard disk coolectively make one storage called LUN where we can create partition. LUN = Logical unit number 
HBA card from linux server connect with SAN box HBA via fiber channel cable.

disk discover- diskn scan in linux server to find lun in SAN box.
SAN storage= Target
scsi controller: a controller which control the HDD in SAN

echo "---" > /sys/class/scsi_host/host0/scan 
we run above command three time 


##### Partition
parimary only 4
extented 1
logical 63 (within extented)
Note; extented make on primary then create logical in extented 
sda1 sda2 sda3 sda4 primary and logical always start with sda5.
<a> here represent the drive it may change how many drive we have.partio


Partitiaon table types
1- msdos/mbr (4 primery partition is the msdos/mbr rule)
2-GPT (in GPT we can make 128 primery partitions)
parted -l /dev/sdb: use to check the partituon table type

sync: this commnad write the data from memory to hard disk. this command can be use after creating partintion 

df -hT : here T used to displya file system as well.
for permonant mount we add the mount data in to etc/fstab
: Note:
after that we check chcek the mount using mount -a 
this coomand chcek the mount is correct or not.
fstab: contains 7 feilds : FSCK is the last two feilds , This is used for file system check and recover.

badbolcks -v /dev/sda1: this is used to check bas sector or blocks in disk.
 if we have badblock than recover using fsck commnad

e2fsck /dev/sda1: this is used to recover file ystem (clean bad sectors)
e2fsck -yc /dev/sda1: this same as above but give complete details of the recovery. Here -y is also used to automate the repariming systems.
etc/fstab: in this file we add the mounted driver detail to mount it permomentlyinstead of adding 'dev/sdc1' driver name ad first feild we can add UUID=universer unique ID for the vcoresponding deriver 
blkid /etc/sdc1 : this command used to find block.
it is stored in etc/disk/by-uuid/
lsblk: this is teh best command to check the app partition details with deriver:


wc -l = world count list: it is used to count files 

ls | wc l: here pipe | is used to assign the output of first command into secint


fstab: it contains 6 feilds 
feilds 5: indicates permisions values 
thesee cane be used in feild 5: ro (read only), user,nouser, noauto,noexex
if it is default: default contains seven things
auto,rw,dev,async,suid,exec, nouser
after changes run commad mount -o remount /part1/


Interview Question:  
1-apache. lvm,mysqk,boot process, suid, stickybiy
2-Difernece b/w mkfs.ext3, mkfs.ext2, mkfs.ext4, xfs etc fdind its answer.
journaling : maintain additional metadada recorders.
ext2: non journaling file system, less file crash recovery 
ext3: if we use this file system we can make 32000 folder, journaling FS, fast file crash recovery, we can to off journaling, signle file can be upto 2TB
ext4: 64k folder can be made, we can off/no journaling, signgle file can be upto 16TB, no snapshots.
xfs: data performance very dood, take snapshots






######## Processs and deamons #####
the file which are loaded in RAm called open files.
to check open files use command : lsof : mean list open files



################### grep ####
this command used to grep the specific items

grep gdm  /etc/passwd: this mean show gdm from the /etc/passwd file
grep gdm --color /etc/passwd: this is used to show color
grep -A1  /etc/passwd : this show the next 1 line as wll
note A2: show next two line and soon on

ls /etc/* |grep -i host : hear i used to ignore small and captial leter include both

ls /etc/* | grep -1 host | wc -l: show th world cpunt list from the output result




###### Find and locate
find: It is slow, chcek each file and folder to the provide  query, i does not ubased on database.
locate; it is fast, it maintain databases, databases location is /var/lib/mlocate/mlocate.db, 
locate need to update databse if new file created 

#### find
find /etc/ -iname host*: find all host here i incicate include uper and lower cases both.
find / -name "*.txt" : find all txt file


#### locate
locate psdd: locate psdd file 

updatedb: this command update the locate db. if new files are created.


####### process and deamons #####
What are Process monitoring tools?

ps : this command usec to find process for current terminal <echo $$> this command can also be used instead of ps.
ps -el: this give list of the process
ps aux: it show the process list with cpu used by him. it beteer instead of ps -el.
kill <[process id>: this command used to kill the process
pidof <name of the process>: This command use to get the process id
pgrep <name of teh process>: this also used to find process id
pkill <name of the provess>: kill the process

pstree: this gives the whole tree of the processs
lsof: this show all process
top: its also show process (it sis similiar to control panel in window)
we can to not store the realtime output of the top in to a file. it we want then we pass n1 flag with > 
top -n1 > /opt/top.txt

Note: init have pid 1 always, and it is called father of all process.(it is till RHEL 6). IN RHEL 7/8 systemd is the father of all process.


###### How to check the load of the process ###

top: this is teh command to check load 
/proc: this  directory contains process filse navigatted from RAM.

#### 1- first row indicate the update of the system and user.
this uptime can also be seen using.
1- uptime: command
2-/Proc/uptime

####2- load in fisrt line, fisrt show 1 mint, 2nd show 5 mint, 3rd show 15 mint previous load.
Note : free -m : this used to chcek used and free RAM memory.

&: this is used to put the process in background with in the shell.
example: gedit&: this process run in background, if you terminae the termina then this process finshed.

nohup: this put the process in the background out of the shell.


fg:to the chcek the backgroup process (bg,jobs: thes commands also used)

##### How kill works
it communinoayte kernal 
kill -l: it shows the all signals of the kill used.
bydefault it used 15 number signals 
to kill anly process by force used signal 9: kill -9 <pid> 


##### how to terminate the init processs ####

init has pid 1: this can not be kill also with forcefully .
to kill this process we used BOM: Fork bombing.
:(){};: this command fill the RAM and crash the whole system.

How to limit FORK BOMING?


############## DEamons mean services ####
atlast it is a process.
one you start it keep running once you stop.
example:
run ls in terminal it run and end.: it process.
open firfox and run atleast we close it: it is deamons

deamon are two types. 
applications: deamons: if we kill this deamons no impact os system,
example: gedit, firfox, terminal
system deamons: if we kill this deamons this may crash system. 
example: init
