#### Partition Logic


Why OS shows less capacity as mentioned in the label HDD?

1 cylender = 8 MB approximate nad if HDD in MB then 1 cylender=1MB
cylender x 8 MB = MBs/ 1024 = GBs.

space for partition is calculated based on cylender. Free space can be calculated by total cylender - used in partition.
