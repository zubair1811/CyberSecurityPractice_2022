### Vulnerability Assessment:
1- examination of infromation system security, incuding system connected to the internet, applications, and online network equipmen components via vulnerability scanners.
2- a systematic review of security waekness i  a  information system.

TYES of VA
1- Host Assessment
2- Network and wirless Asessment
3- Database assessment
4- Application Assessment

Penetration tests classification:
* Black box tests:tester completly ignorant of the system, and obtained information DNS, WEb, email, and internet service from server that are exposed publically by comapny
* white box test:  oppostite of black box test, tester communicate with non-IT staff face to face to collect information, network topoly, employ information
* Covert test: test the ability of the inspection unit monitor, respond to, and recover information security event



####  VA Steps
1- Reconnaissance
2- scanning
3- Gaining Access
4- Maintaing Access
5- Clearning Tracks 


#### ------------- LABS on Ghanima -----------------
#### 1-MAP the network
Network Mappper (NMAP): It is a network maping tool. port scanner. commonly used for security audits
provides, port taple, re erse DNS names, OS, device types and MAC addresses

-A: perform an aggressve scan
-sP: perm only ping scan
-sS: TCP SYN scan
-sT: TCP connect scan
-sU: UDP scan 
-sO: IP prorocol scan
-F ; Fast scan
-p: scan specofc port
-O: Operating Systsen detaction (O is capital)
-sV: Service version detection 
-open : only display open ports
-packet-trace: trace packets
-Pn: port scan only no host doscovery, treat all host as online -- skip host discovery 
-oN: output in a file
-T<time>: defin etime to send packets; T4 for per request
  
lab on Ghanima: sudo nmap -sS -A -p 9000 -T4 -O -Pn -oN nmap_practice corruptpolitico.com

#### 2-Hunting down the user profile
  TOOL Name: Sherlock, it is a web scrapper.
  
go to [sherlock](https://github.com/sherlock-project/sherlock) colne the repo into the system, go into sherlock dir 
run requirments file follwing command
 
``` 
# install the requirements
$ python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
how to run
  *  python3 sherlock <profileer name>
  *  python3 sherlock eric
  
This search the usr name in  the list of the website in sites.md
  
##### 3- VA using ZAP
Tool Name: [ZAP](https://www.zaproxy.org/). It is from OWASP. Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP)
  It is ulternatice of Burp Suit
  
  
##### 4- Burp Suit Installation
  community version free.
  Target ---> Issue defination: This have list of all VA that can be detected. IN scope we can  addd specific webste as target
  Intruder: it set the payload based on given word list.
  Extender: Bapp store: GIve us external extentions.
  
  ###### Integrate External Browser with Burp Suit
  Steps 
  1- Instal foxyProxy extention in browser
   after instaltion Clik on options, add name, HTTP (requast), IP: local host 127.0.0.1, any port number lke 8085. Okay. It show new name in extention
  2- IT will not work with new set proxy. need Certificate. go http://burp/ down load certificate and add ingto browser setting
   setting --> certificate import certificate and add downloaded certificate.
  3- In proxy (Brup Suit click Intrutor on and then click forward). 
  then in prxy HTTP history check all histroy of the requst which goes through set proxy. 

 Personal NOTE: 
  1- Watch Playing arount with Burp Suit from VA lectures
  2- Watch Intruuction to Burp Suit from WSTG
